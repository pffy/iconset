## QUICK START

### Make an icon set with icons

Basically, you can take a big icon, and make a set of smaller ones.

```bash
iconset foo.png
```

An icon set is generated by resizing the input icon tnto smaller icons.

### Make a placeholder icon set with color input 

You can also create blank placeholder icons with specific colors:

Hexadecimal color input works:

```bash
iconset ff6600
```

RGB color input also works:

```bash
iconset rgb-255-55-120
```
